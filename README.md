# SwiftUI-SQL-ExpMaker
This is a self contained view to manage the creation and state of a SQL Where clause. Slider, Picker, and Bindings 

# Installation
There is one dependency. We use the great slider here:

https://github.com/spacenation/sliders

# Usuage
This assumes you have some datamodel that will hold the various bindings for each query. This shows how to use a Picker and a Slider to output different SQL where clauses.
